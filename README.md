LANGUAGES USED: HTML & CSS


HTML: This is a basic form page that includes the name, email and password with a 'Sign In' button. This was done by using tags such as form, label, input and button. 

CSS: This focuses solely on the aesthetics of the form page with a moon theme (didn't realize how much I miss CSS lol), using a minimalistic style with the inclusion of flex, transition.

This ia a refresher course in the creation of a basic HTML page and CSS, and GitHub.


P.S This is my first time using the ReadME, and definitely will be one of the worst note. I'll do better in the next.
